                    <div id="abstract1" class="abstract">
                        <p>To combat lung cancer, the deadliest cancer worldwide, the United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends annual lung cancer screening for high-risk individuals based on the results from National Lung Screening Trials (NLST), but self-selection may limit its effectiveness in reducing mortality rates. I develop a dynamic discrete-choice model incorporating the NLST's participation decision and the lung cancer screening decision, to examine the factors driving lung cancer screening decisions and how self-selection impacts health outcomes and spending. Using the NLST participant's data and the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS 2015) data, this paper explores three factors: beliefs about lung cancer risk, survival rates, and the costs and benefits of screening (including uncertainties surrounding screening results, i.e. false positives/negatives, and the subsequent treatments). The results highlight that people with lower lung cancer risk are more likely to undergo screenings. Compared to those who do not undergo screening, trial participants who are screened tend to have lower mortality rates, whereas individuals in the general population who are screened tend to have higher mortality rates. Counterfactual analysis suggests that we can reduce mortality rates more effectively when targeting underrepresented groups than mandating all eligible people to screen for lung cancer. Although higher screening rates may not reduce mortality rates, they are likely to result in cost savings for lung cancer care.</p>

                    <div id="abstract2" class="abstract">
                        <p>Analyzing Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) data spanning from 1999 to 2019, we use a simultaneous equation model with censored dependent variables, to estimate the spousal effects on smoking behavior as well as the effects of spousal health conditions. By accounting for previous smoking behaviors, state-level cigarette taxes, and unobserved heterogeneity, the model allows us to address simultaneity, homophily, and confounding issues without concerning multiple equilibria. We also consider mental illness records, pregnancy, and health-related occupations, on which smoking awareness and attitude depend heavily. We account for the hidden states of lung disease and heart disease variables, which include: the husband and wife’s respective family history of smoking and their family economic status, state-level COPD prevalence, alcohol use, and past diabetes. Our result highlights a strong and positive spousal effect on smoking behaviors. Specifically, husbands tend to smoke less if wives are associated with a higher likelihood of lung disease, while the corresponding effect is the opposite in wives' equation. Mental illness history increases the propensity and intensity to smoke for both husband and wife, with wives being statistically significant. A wife is less likely to smoke during her pregnancy, an effect that is not significant for the husband.</p>

                    <div id="abstract3" class="abstract">
                        <p>This paper investigates how school violence affects academic outcomes through the impacts on mental health for native-born American and immigrant children. We highlight that preventing school violence can improve mental health and academic performance, thus enhancing economic prospects and promoting generational social mobility. We use a simultaneous equations model to exam the structural relationships of bullying involvement, mental health and academic outcomes. Analyzing the 2022 National Survey of Children’s Health (NSCH2022), our findings reveal that immigrant children are generally less involved as bullies or victims than their native-born children. Yet, children in white immigrant or low-income families are more susceptible to school violence. Controlling factors like parental mental health, attitudes towards children, and life experiences, we find that immigrant children are mentally healthier compared to native-born children, except for white immigrants who experience more significant mental health challenges. Being bullied significantly increases the likelihood of experiencing mental health issues, while being a bully has a converse impact. This effect has no significant difference between immigrant and native-born children. While immigrant children perform better than native-born children academically, those from white immigrant families show worse academic performance. Mental health improves school performance, but this link is weaker in immigrant children.</p>
