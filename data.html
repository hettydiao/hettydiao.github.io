            <h2>Data I Worked With</h2>
            <p>I have extensive experience working with various types of large data, including large survey, cancer registry, clinical trials, and electronic health record data:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Health and Retirement Study (HRS)</strong> – A long-term panel study surveying older Americans to gather data on health, retirement, income, and wealth.</li>
                <li><strong>Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID)</strong> – A longitudinal panel survey of U.S. individuals and families to assess economic, social, and health factors over time.</li>
                <li><strong>Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS)</strong> – A set of large-scale surveys of families and individuals, their medical providers, and employers to collect data on the cost and use of healthcare.</li>
                <li><strong>National Health Interview Survey (NHIS)</strong> – A national survey used to track the health of the U.S. population by collecting data on a broad range of health topics.</li>
                <li><strong>Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)</strong> – A large cancer registry program that provides information on cancer statistics and trends across the U.S.</li>
                <li><strong>National Lung Screening Trial (NLST)</strong> – A large clinical trial aimed at determining if low-dose CT scans are effective in reducing lung cancer deaths compared to chest x-rays.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Through working with these datasets, I have developed expertise in cleaning, managing, and analyzing large datasets, making informed decisions using econometric and statistical tools.</p>
